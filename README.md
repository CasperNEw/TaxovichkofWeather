# TaxovichkofWeather

Test task from the company "Taxovichkof"

Create an application (the design does not matter) to display the weather.

- The first screen: two tabs St. Petersburg and Moscow, in which the list displays the weather by day, header - it displays the current weather for the selected tab.
- Second screen: Google Maps map, when you click on the map, load and display the weather at this point. Add Current Location Function

- All downloaded data must be cached and used within 1 hour. API - darksky net

Dark Sky has joined Apple and will no longer accept new signups. =/
So I chose the API OpenWeather.

To create the application, I used the frameworks 'SwiftLint', 'RealmSwift', 'SDWebImage' and 'GoogleMaps'.
It took me about 25-30 hours to create, debug, test and speed up the application.
This was my first experience with google maps and my first experience writing "complex" data processing logic.
It was cool! )
